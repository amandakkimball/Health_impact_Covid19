# Project to predict Covid19 severity from the known health indicator data within a community

This project utilizes the information from the Center for Disease Controls Behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFSS, 2011-2017) to determine if Covid19 severity within a community can be predicted from known health indicators. 

**This is a work in progress.** 

The initial code to review, compile, aggregate by metropolitan area, and merge have been uploaded. Here is the correlation plot for that data, as a teaser.
